        <h1>Educational Scholarship Advisor</h1>
        <h2>AI Expert System Project</h2>
        <p>The Educational Scholarship Advisor is a rule-based expert system designed to assist students in determining their eligibility for scholarships based on academic performance, family income, and extracurricular activities.</p>

        <h2>Use Case & System Design</h2>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Lionel Messi, a student, enters his GPA, family income, and extracurricular details. The system evaluates his data against predefined IF-THEN rules to determine scholarship eligibility.</p>

        <h2>Key Stakeholders</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Students:</strong> Seek guidance on scholarship eligibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Scholarship Organizations:</strong> Manage scholarship applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Parents:</strong> Provide financial details for evaluation.</li>
            <li><strong>Governments:</strong> Ensure fair and accessible funding distribution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Decision Rules</h2>
        <p>The system follows a structured set of IF-THEN rules, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IF</strong> GPA > 3.5 AND family income < $5,000 <strong>THEN</strong> eligible for scholarship.</li>
            <li><strong>IF</strong> GPA > 3.0 AND involved in extracurricular activities <strong>THEN</strong> eligible for partial scholarship.</li>
            <li><strong>IF</strong> GPA < 2.5 <strong>THEN</strong> ineligible; needs improvement in academics.</li>
        </ul>
