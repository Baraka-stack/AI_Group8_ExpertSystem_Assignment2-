## Project Overview
A rule-based expert system designed to help Rwandan/African students determine their eligibility for various scholarships based on academic performance, background, and other relevant criteria.


## System Features
- Academic eligibility assessment
- Financial need evaluation
- Scholarship matching based on student profile
- Recommendation generation with explanations


## How It Works
The system follows these steps:
1. Collects student information including academic history, financial status, field of study, etc.
2. Applies rule-based logic to evaluate eligibility for different scholarship types
3. Matches student profiles against scholarship requirements
4. Generates personalized recommendations with explanations

## Technical Implementation
- Built using Python for the backend logic
- Rule-based expert system architecture


## Usage Instructions
you must have your gpa and know your strengths and family income annually

## Repository Structure
- `main.py`: Primary Python code for the expert system
- `docs/`: Documentation files including flowcharts and system design
- `tests/`: Test cases and testing documentation

## Development Process
This system was developed through an incremental process over three days:
- Day 1: Use case definition and rule identification
- Day 2: System design and initial implementation
- Day 3: Final development, testing, and deployment
